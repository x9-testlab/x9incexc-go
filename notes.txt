Libraries

	Argument parsers
		alexflint/go-arg
			https://github.com/alexflint/go-arg
			Notes:
				- Looks good and simple
				- Actively maintained
		jessevdk/go-flags
			https://github.com/jessevdk/go-flags
			go get github.com/jessevdk/go-flags
			import "github.com/jessevdk/go-flags"
			Notes:
				- Like go's flags, but more advanced.
				- Looks perfect?
				- May be abandoned (try it)?
			Docs & examples:
				https://godoc.org/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags
		spf13/cobra
			https://github.com/spf13/cobra
			go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra
			import "github.com/spf13/cobra"
			Notes:
				- Very powerful & used by many major applications
				- Requires a highly specific application structure. Each command gets it's own .go file under app/cmd.
				- Probably too complex.
			Docs & examples:
				https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/blob/master/commands/list.go
		docopt/docopt.go
			https://github.com/docopt/docopt.go
			go get github.com/docopt/docopt-go
			import "github.com/docopt/docopt-go"
			Notes:
				- Looks really simple!
				- "docopt parses command-line arguments based on a help message. Don't write parser code: a good help message already has all the necessary information in it."
				- Not maintained, me be too old for go modules?
			Docs & examples:
				https://github.com/docopt/docopt#help-message-format
		teris-io/cli
			https://github.com/teris-io/cli
			Notes:
				- Barely documented
		akamensky/argparse
			https://github.com/akamensky/argparse

				- "...bring ease of use and flexibility of [Python's] argparse to Go."
				- "it is messy right now and could use a major revamp"
		clagraff/argparse
			https://github.com/clagraff/argparse
			Notes:
				- No Longer Supported

	Sqlite3
		mattn/go-sqlite3
			https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
			go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
			import (
				"database/sql"
